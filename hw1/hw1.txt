Files you check in outside of specific homework or assignment directory will not be reviewed or graded for that homework/assignment.

Check in and modify files as many times as you like. You will not be able to modify the files after the deadline.

You will work as a pair, both of you are responsible for the completed work in all assignments and homework. Each of you are expected to put in your reasonable share of effort into it.

The deadlines are strict, there will be no extensions. Don't email any code to Venkat. Your last check in before the deadline will be graded. So, if you break the code (in assignments) before the deadline, you will lose.

Please feel free to ask for frequent reviews (see the reviews/readme.txt file for details on how to ask for reviews).

You can evolve the answers and solutions based on the reviews to your pair and to other pairs in the course. Only the latest checkin at the time of review will be looked at. Also the final check in will be the only one graded.

Now to homework #1.

Homework 1: Due July 13th, 11:59PM

To answer this question, read, but express the ideas in your own words. If something that you read is very expressive and you like to use it, you can use the exact words, but place the words within quotes and provide reference. Copying and pasting sentences or paragraphs from other sources is considered plagiarism, so don't copy and paste (or type exact words without proper reference).
