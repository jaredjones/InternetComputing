review: revisit 1, improve 2 and 3

1. Need to fix a few terminologies.
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/uhcsu15ic/K7xlIdAUsII/eqH_xSC2YxoJ>
Rework with these terms.

Also, discuss this term first for variables. Then discuss this for functions and how that may be different in some ways. Write in short paragraphs.

2. What's a container object (context object?)? What's the purpose of such a context object?
ladder to latter

3.
"As stated in the answer to the prior question, " - remove, noise words, does not add value.
"want to take over the scope of a function" what does taking over scope mean?

Remove some noise words "A programmer should use call when" to "use call when"

spell check the document.
